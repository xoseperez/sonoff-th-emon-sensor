# Sonoff TH Energy Monitor Sensor

This repo includes Open Source Hardware (OSHW) to connect a CT to a Sonoff TH via the 2.5mm jack port. To do it we will use a I2C ADC board with a 3.5mm jack on one side to connect the CT and different connectors on the other to wire a TRRS cable.

This repository includes a board with a ADC121 single-channel ADC and a ADS1114 four channel ADC.
